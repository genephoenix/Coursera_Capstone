Many a time one might hear about news about how there may not be enough space at a hospital for all the patients needing help and when there comes a time like an epidemic or a pandemic (as is the current state of things in the world), this is especially the case. This report will likely be of interest to the board of directors and stakeholders of the hospital in question as well as the city of Toronto staff. \n    \n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Our aim is to look for populated areas in neighbourhoods where there appears to be more young children and elderly present. Once those neighbourhoods have been found, we will then search the surrounding area for any other such health centres in the vicinity as we would like to construct the hospital in a distance far enough away from the others in an area where it would be most needed.\n    \n<p>\n\n<p>\n    Using this criteria and our purpose along with relevant data to provide support, we aim to share our findings and reasonings for our choices on where we would advise them to construct the health centre.\n    \n</p>"
